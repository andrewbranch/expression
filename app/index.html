            <h2>What?</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Andrew. I&rsquo;m a web designer/developer, a <a href="http://andrewbranch.bandcamp.com">musician</a>, and, at the time of this writing, an electrical engineering student at <a href="http://www.auburn.edu">Auburn University</a>. I&rsquo;m currently working on a design project in which I&rsquo;m making some very cool additions to the electronics of my acoustic guitar. As I progress, I&rsquo;ll add media and documentation here. You&rsquo;ll find video and audio clips, photos and figures, and moderately technical exposition, as well as links to the more formal documentation that the course requires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike a traditional blog, I&rsquo;ll put my newest material at the bottom of the page so that when I&rsquo;m done, readers will be able to start at the beginning and read forward to get a full understanding of the process. Think of this as a book. A <i>New York Times</i> best-seller, perhaps.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <h3>January 24, 2014</h3>
            <p>
              I am very lucky to have a beautiful 2010 <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/614ce">Taylor 614ce</a>. At that time, the 400 series and everything above shipped with a magnetic pickup and preamplification system, christened the <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/features/Electronics/Expression-System">Taylor Expression System&reg;</a> (ES). Taylor made it out to be a really big deal, claiming incredible improvements in tone and natural acoustical character over the ubiquitous piezoelectric under-saddle transducer (UST).
            </p>
            <figure class="figure-transparent"><div class="img-container" id="figure-es"><img src="images/es-diagram@2x.png"></div></figure>
            <p>
              The Expression System <em>is</em> very different, to say the least. It consists of three magnetic pickups: two little round guys on the underside of the body, and one longish one underneath the neck. Most of the volume comes from the neck pickup; in fact, you can reach inside the soundhole and flip little switches on the preamp board and turn off the body pickups entirely. Their contribution to the sound, or lack thereof, makes a relatively subtle tonal difference.
            </p>
            <p>Sadly, I do not share Taylor&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the ES. It sounds squawky and uninspiring, like plugging any acoustic-electric guitar into an electric guitar amp. Actually, I can do a little better than that description by letting you hear for yourself. I recorded my guitar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DI_unit">direct injected</a> simultaneously with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone_practice#X-Y_technique:_intensity_stereophony">XY stereo pair</a> of <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm81-instrument-microphone">SM81 microphones</a>. First you&rsquo;ll hear the clip as the microphones heard it, and then you&rsquo;ll hear the pure amplified sound.</p>

              But then, maybe the sweet, serenading style of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/our-endless-numbered-days/id5644896">Sam Beam</a> isn&rsquo;t the most revealing test case for the Expression System&rsquo;s shortcomings. The ES doesn&rsquo;t sound truly hokey until you strum hard, like <a href="http://noahgundersen.bandcamp.com/album/family">Noah&nbsp;does</a>:

              So, in 2012, I decided to install a traditional UST in my guitar. However, I wanted to continue to be able to use the tastefully discrete volume and equilization knobs already on my guitar. I decided I would splice the UST signal into the same input as the neck input&rsquo;s signal, also allowing me to continue using the old pickups alongside (or instead of) the new piezo transducer if I so wished. After trying this with virtually inaudible results, a little research told me that piezo pickups have extraordinarily high output impedance. This essentially meant that the preamp I was splicing my signal into was specifically tailored to work efficiently with those magnetic pickups, and the electrical charateristics of the UST were too far outside the range of what the preamp could handle.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make the UST work with the existing preamp, I had to lower its output impedance by a huge factor. I did this by adding another small circuit board containing a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_amplifier#Voltage_buffer">voltage follower amplifier</a> to the innards of my guitar. The only place I could put it reliably was way down by the output jack and battery compartment. By this point, the number of wires running back and forth in the guitar had grown considerably, while the frustrating tedium of constantly having to blindly reach my hands at strange angles inside the soundhole had taken a serious toll on the neatness and precision of my work.

            <p>Long story short, to my surprise, it worked quite nicely for several months. But eventually, after all the vibration and jostling around that comes with regularly transporting and playing an instrument, the whole system shorted out and my acoustic-electric guitar became just acoustic for a few years.</p>

            <p>
              Not to be defeated by my previous failure, my objective now is to redesign and reimplement the system I almost succeeded in building back in 2012, with a significant addition: a <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx">Bluetooth&reg; Low-Energy</a> microcontroller that will allow me to switch between the neck, body, and under-saddle pickups <em>with my phone</em>.

              <h2>Sound Design</h2>
              <h3>April 25, 2014</h3>
              <p>
                  Well, I dropped the ball on updating this as I went along, but I'm going to attempt to recover some ground here.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The first part of designing my modification I had to tackle was the buffer amp for the UST. I picked a high-quality op amp, the <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/all-operational-amplifiers-op-amps/operational-amplifiers-op-amps/ad843/products/product.html">AD843</a>, based on the <a href="http://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamps.html">detailed comparison</a> from Warren Young, and began prototyping.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I could test any of my designs, though, I had to do some grunt work to be able to access the inputs and outputs of the guitar&rsquo;s electronics that I needed. Back in 2012, I really half-assed this step, and it made the rest of the project a nightmare. This is what a nightmare looks like:
              </p>
              <figure class="figure-photo">
                <div class="img-container" id="figure-old-setup"><img src="images/old-setup.jpg" alt="My old development setup: a tangle of short wires coming out of the guitar and terminating at a breadboard that sits on top of the body of the guitar."></div>
                <figcaption>My old development setup. Not very convenient.</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                So this time around, I drilled a quick board to intercept all the important lines and brought them outside of the guitar in a neat, six-foot bundle of wires.
              </p>
              <figure class="figure-photo">

              </figure>
              <p>
                With that board installed, I could hash out my amplifier circuit on a breadboard at a comfortable distance away.
              </p>
              <figure class="figure-photo">

                <figcaption>Turns out sitting at a desk is much more comfortable.</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                After some experimentation, I ended up with a simple inverting amplifier with an active low-pass filter to get rid of a lot of scratchy, screechy high-frequency energy from the piezo. Since everything has to run off the guitar&rsquo;s single 9-volt battery, I had to bias the non-inverting input of the op amp at somewhere around 4.5 V. A 100k&Omega;/100k&Omega; resistor divider would do alright, except that the high impedance seen there would kill the low-frequency response. At the same time, a low-valued resistor divider would waste a lot of power. But I like to have my cake and eat it too, so I put the 100k&Omega; divider in front of a single-transistor voltage follower, which has a very low output impedance without sinking a lot of current.
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                Everything worked and sounded pretty good, but there was a disturbing amount of hiss and hum permeating the system. A breadboard is already a harsh environment for any system to operate, so knowing that I was running a low-impedance amplifier output back across the room on a 6-foot 20 AWG wire made me approach that unwanted noise with a grain of salt. I decided to make a PCB for my circuit so far and see how it performed inside the guitar.
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                After a few hours, a few fluid ounces of hydrochloric acid, one really tiny drill bit, and a handful solder joints, I had this guy:

              </figure>
              <p>
                I installed him into the guitar, employing a highly sophisticated mounting strategy,

                </figure>
                and tried it out. I was thrilled to find that the noise floor was way down, pretty much inaudible at normal levels. Here&rsquo;s an audio sample:
