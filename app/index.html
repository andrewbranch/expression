            <h2>What?</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Andrew. I&rsquo;m a web designer/developer, a musician, and, at the time of this writing, an electrical engineering student at <a href="http://www.auburn.edu">Auburn University</a>. I&rsquo;m currently working on a design project in which I&rsquo;m making some very cool additions to the electronics of my acoustic guitar. As I make progress, I&rsquo;ll add media and documentation here. You&rsquo;ll find video and audio clips, photos and figures, and moderately technical exposition, as well as links to the more formal documentation that the course requires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike a traditional blog, I&rsquo;ll put my newest material at the bottom of the page so that when I&rsquo;m done, readers will be able to start at the beginning and read forward to get a full understanding of the process. Think of this as a book. A New York Times best-seller, perhaps.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <h3>January 24, 2014</h3>
            <p>
              I am very lucky to have a beautiful 2010 <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/614ce">Taylor 614ce</a>. At that time, the 400 series and everything above shipped with a magnetic pickup and preamplification system, christened the <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/features/Electronics/Expression-System">Taylor Expression System&reg;</a> (ES). Taylor made it out to be a really big deal, claiming incredible improvements in tone and natural acoustical character over the ubiquitous piezoelectric under-saddle transducer (UST).
            </p>
            <figure class="figure-transparent"><div class="img-container" id="figure-es"><img src="images/es-diagram@2x.png"></div></figure>
            <p>
              The Expression System <em>is</em> very different, to say the least. It consists of three magnetic pickups: two little round guys on the underside of the body, and one longish one underneath the neck. Most of the volume comes from the neck pickup; in fact, you can reach inside the soundhole and flip little switches on the preamp board and turn off the body pickups entirely. Their contribution to the sound, or lack thereof, makes a relatively subtle tonal difference.
            </p>
            <p>Sadly, I do not share Taylor&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the ES. It sounds squawky and uninspiring, like plugging any acoustic-electric guitar into an electric guitar amp. Actually, I can do a little better than that description by letting you hear for yourself. I recorded my guitar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DI_unit">direct injected</a> simultaneously with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone_practice#X-Y_technique:_intensity_stereophony">XY stereo pair</a> of <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm81-instrument-microphone">SM81 microphones</a>. First you&rsquo;ll hear the clip as the microphones heard it, and then you&rsquo;ll hear the pure amplified sound.</p>

              But then, maybe the sweet, serenading style of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/our-endless-numbered-days/id5644896">Sam Beam</a> isn&rsquo;t the most revealing test case for the Expression System&rsquo;s shortcomings. The ES doesn&rsquo;t sound truly hokey until you strum hard, like <a href="http://noahgundersen.bandcamp.com/album/family">Noah&nbsp;does</a>:

              So, in 2012, I decided to install a traditional UST in my guitar. However, I wanted to continue to be able to use the tastefully discrete volume and equilization knobs already on my guitar. I decided I would splice the UST signal into the same input as the neck input&rsquo;s signal, also allowing me to continue using the old pickups alongside (or instead of) the new piezo transducer if I so wished. After trying this with virtually inaudible results, a little research told me that piezo pickups have extraordinarily high output impedance. This essentially meant that the preamp I was splicing my signal into was specifically tailored to work efficiently with those magnetic pickups, and the electrical charateristics of the UST were too far outside the range of what the preamp could handle.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make the UST work with the existing preamp, I had to lower its output impedance by a huge factor. I did this by adding another small circuit board containing a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_amplifier#Voltage_buffer">voltage follower amplifier</a> to the innards of my guitar. The only place I could put it reliably was way down by the output jack and battery compartment. By this point, the number of wires running back and forth in the guitar had grown considerably, while the frustrating tedium of constantly having to blindly reach my hands at strange angles inside the soundhole had taken a serious toll on the neatness and precision of my work.

            <p>Long story short, to my surprise, it worked quite nicely for several months. But eventually, after all the vibration and jostling around that comes with regularly transporting and playing an instrument, the whole system shorted out and my acoustic-electric guitar became just acoustic for a few years.</p>

            <h3>January 30, 2014</h3>
            <p>
              Not to be defeated by my previous failure, my objective now is to redesign and reimplement the system I almost succeeded in building back in 2012, with a significant addition: a <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx">Bluetooth&reg; Low-Energy</a> microcontroller that will allow me to mix the sound of the neck, body, and under-saddle pickups <em>with my phone</em>.
